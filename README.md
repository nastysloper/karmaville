# Welcome to KarmaVille

## Getting Started

KarmaVille uses [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).  Run the following commands to get started:

```text
$ git clone git://github.com/Devbootcamp/karmaville.git
$ cd karmaville
$ bundle install
$ rake db:setup
```

The `rake db:setup` command could take several minutes to run.

1. No idea. I'm seeing add_index and new classes, but I don't know why.
2. It looks like people are summing karma points and adding that to the users table, 
which is the only thing that makes sense to me.
